Many hailed the recommendation, which proposes the name of 3 women judges, as a historic step towards gender equality in the Court. Others have criticized the decision for not including the name of Chief Justice Akil Kureshi, alleging that the collegium had given in to government pressure. Both camps, however, were basing their conclusions on conjecture. We neither know whether the court had gender in mind while selecting the list nor do we know whether Justice Kureshi was not selected due to government pressure. Since the SCI collegium does not give public reasons for its recommendations, we simply do not know the criteria that the SCI uses to appoint judges.\nExisting Studies and Counterfactual Problems\rThere have been several attempts at understanding the criteria for judicial appointments. For example, Gadbois, through extensive interviews with Judges and their families, was the first person to be able to construct short biographies of Judges in the SCI from 1950-1989. Using these, Gadbois showed that while the official criteria for the appointment of SCI judges was broad, the average SCI judge was likely to be selected based on region, experience, and socio-economic characteristics. Gadbois described an archetypal Judge in the SCI as a upper-class Hindu Brahmin who had served as a former High Court Chief Justice. Expanding Gadbois’ study to Judges appointed till 2013, Chandrachud also attempted to map the informal factors which affect the appointment of judges. Through the use of both public biographies of judges as well as interviews, Chandrachud argues that the most important criteria for appointment as a SCI judge was their experience as a High Court judge as well as the regional diversity of the SCI. The more senior a high court judge and the less represented their parent high court on the SCI, the higher the chance of elevation.\nRecent work has reiterated the sailence of these criteria. In their recent article, Chandra, Hubbard and Kalantry show that the advent of the collegium system led to a very little change in the biographical characteristics of judges appointed to the SCI. The only noticeable change is that post-collegium SCI judges are more likely to be from private practice and spend more time as high court judges than judges appointed before the advent of the collegium system. Kumar also posits that the SCI prefers people who practiced for some time rather than those who served in the lower judiciary. Fayiz and Saxena argue that the court mostly appoints Hindu Upper Caste judges.\nApart from the Gadbois’ interviews, these studies rely on public biographies of the judges available on the SCI website. Yet, as Tripathy \u0026amp; Bagga demonstrate these official biographies are often incomplete and lack crucial socio-economic information about the judges. Even assuming that these biographies were complete, there is an inherent limitation to the use of biographical information of appointed judges to infer the criteria that was used to appoint them. Unfortunately, we do not know whether the things we happen to observe in the biography of SCI judges are related to their appointment. Take, for instance, the case of a hypothetical Judge A, whose parent high court is Allahabad High Court, the largest high court in India. Let us assume the SCI, which has no judges from the Allahabad High Court, appoints Judge A. Can we conclude that Judge A was appointed due to her parent high court? No. Judge A may have been chosen because she was perceived to be a good judge or because she was simply the senior most judge in the all india high court roster.\nThis is known as the counterfactual difficulty of causal inference. Without knowing the counterfactual– in this case whether Judge A would have still been appointed had she not been a part of Allahabad high court– we cannot make conclusions about the role of the parent high court in the appointment process. In most cases, it is impossible to study a counterfactual in real world settings- after all we cannot go back in time and assign Judge A to another high court. One approximation method that we use often in social science to mimic this process is called Matching. In matching, we try to find Judge A’s twin, say Judge B, who is similar to Judge A in all respects, except the parent High court. Let us assume now, that Judge A was appointed and Judge B was not. In this case, since the parent high court was the only difference between the two judges we can conclude that it is a criteria for appointments to the SCI. Let us for the moment ignore the extremely difficult empirical problem of finding a “similar” non-appointed counterpart to all the judges in the SCI. What should be apparent is that to even theoretically attempt this exercise, we need not only the biographical characteristics of all judges of the SCI who were appointed but also the biographical characteristics of all candidates who were not appointed. If we assume all candidates are high court judges, to truly understand the appointment process, we would need the biographical characteristics of all high court judges.1\n\rCollegium Resolutions\rThere is ofcourse, another simpler way of knowing the criteria for appointment of judges–simply asking the people who select the judges.2 In the case of the SCI, this is the Chief Justice and after 1993, the collegium. Till now however, the Gadbois interviews remain the only place where we have judges commenting on the appointment process. Even this is mostly anecdotal and limited to particular judges. Beyond the rhetoric of seniority and merit, Chief Justices have remained silent on the general criteria they use for selecting judges in the higher judiciary. This is why the publication of collegium resolutions was an extremely important development in our understanding of the judiciary. On October 3rd, 2017, the Supreme Court Collegium in a historic move resolved that the reasons for its decisions on the appointment of Judges will be uploaded to the Supreme Court’s Website.The resolution then was seen as a break from the past which would “maintain and enhance public confidence in the integrity and impartiality”.\nThese public resolutions marked the first time that the SCI gave public reasons for its appointment decisions. They were not verbatim minutes of the collegium meetings, but were still very revealing. In the first of its resolutions, for example, the court listed several criteria which it used for the appointment of high court judges. For judges appointed to the high court from the bench, the main criteria was seniority and the report of the judgement committee about their lower court judgments. For judges appointed from the bar, there was an objective criteria for age and income. In both cases, the judges took into account the reports of the Information Bureau on the integrity and professional image of the candidate. In some cases, the candidate was called for an interview. What was even more interesting was that the court gave the list of all potential candidates suggested by the High Court as well as specific reasons for why a candidate was rejected. These criteria may not have been exhaustive, but still allowed public engagement with the appointment process.\nThe resolutions for the Supreme Court appointments were unfortunately not as detailed. The only clear criteria expressly considered for SCI appointment was the all-india seniority rank of the judge as well the parent high court. Other than this the resolutions simply stated that the collegium had simply stated that it had taken into consideration “all relevant factors”. The SC appointment resolutions also did not contain information about the candidates considered and rejected.\nThe publication of these detailed resolutions, however, did not last long. Soon after the resolutions started being published, letters from Justice Lokur and Justice Joseph, two members of the collegium, were leaked to the press. Justice Joseph’s letter expressed concern about listing specific reasons for the rejecting candidates, arguing that the information may “violate human rights of some persons”. After this leak and presumably after discussions with collegium members, the uploaded resolutions stopped containing specific reasons for the rejection of particular candidates. When a candidate was to be rejected, the resolutions now simply stated they were rejected due to “material available on record”.\n\rFigure 1: Missingness Map of SCI collegium Resolutions for Appointment of High Court Judges\r\rTo understand the criteria discussed in each of these resolutions, I built a dataset of all collegium resolutions till April 20203. Figure 1 maps changes in the criteria and information given in all collegium resolutions for the appointment of High Court judges. As can be seen, the court gradually stopped giving us information about selection criteria and eventually stopped giving information about each individual candidate altogether. Figure 2 shows the the decline in the number of information points available in each resolution. Within a span of 2 years, the moved from a high of giving 25 information points in each resolution to a low of only 5. The final blow to these detailed resolutions came when a particular collegium decision to transfer Chief Justice Tahilramani and Justice Akil Kureshi was discussed and critiqued in the media. The resolution stated that the transfer was required, “in the interest of better administration of justice, a phrase that had also been used in all prior resolutions recommending transfers. After the heightened media scrutiny questioning the reasons for the transfer, the court released a statement, stating that the decision was made due to “cogent reasons” and “it would not be in the interest of the institution to disclose the reasons for transfer”. Since then the court has chosen to publish only “statements” instead of resolutions, which now only have the names of recommended candidates. It would seem then that the increased public scrutiny and criticism of its decisions, forced the court to revisit its initial move towards transparency. Whenever the court faced a public challenge to its appointment decisions, its response has been to hide how that decision was made. This, as Kumar puts it, “ smacks of institutional cowardice”.\n\rFigure 2: Number of Information Points in SCI collegium Resolutions for Appointment of High Court Judges\r\rBickel in his famous book The Least Dangerous Branch coined the term “the counter-majoritarian difficulty” to describe the fact that in the U.S, an unelected judiciary reviews legislation from the popular branch of government. The counter-majoritarian difficulty is even more pronounced in the SCI- which is the only case in the world where the judiciary appoints its own members and also does not publicly disclose how it makes these appointments. The judges in the Indian higher judiciary are thus not only unelected but also cliquish. Given the central place of the court in deciding the country’s polity, the court’s opacity should be particularly concerning.\n\r\rAs far as I know, Justice Hub’s Summer of Data program is attempting to do this. This is difficult, since public data sources of High Court Judges biographies are extremely sparse.↩︎\n\rThe assumption here is that the judges will be sincere in revealing such criteria. We, however, know that judges have strategic incentives to reveal the most uncontroversial criteria.↩︎\n\rI thank Gauri Balagopal, Tanvi Raina, Sanjitha Umapathy for their assistance in the creation of this dataset.↩︎\n\r\r\r","date":1629849600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629849600,"objectID":"c941a85f283d8f40241914768aa09527","permalink":"https://rahulh.com/post/collegeum-transperancy/","publishdate":"2021-08-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/collegeum-transperancy/","section":"post","summary":"I review literature attempting to determine the criteria for appointment of judges to the Supreme Court of India.

A problem that I consistently encounter in my analysis is the lack of any record of the institutional history of the SCI. Gadbois’s classics on the history of the federal court and on the judges of the Supreme Court gives us some anecdotal information on some court procedure but is limited by time-period. Abhinav Chandrachud’s Supreme whispers (also based on Gadbois’ interviews), similarly has anecdotal information about how the court functioned, but even this is mostly eclectic and sparse. There seems to be nothing, on the lines of Perry’s classic work on the U.S. Supreme Court, that builds a historical account of how institutional rules and conventions in the SCI have changed throughout history.\nMy empirical analysis is thus limited by the lack of background knowledge about how the court functioned at the time each case that I examine was heard. To fully understand decision-making, we need to know how cases were allocated to panels, how these panels admitted cases and how opinions were assigned. The current rules of the court as well as common perceptions about the court process cannot substitute for a clear understanding of how the court’s process has changed over time. Even in the first thousand cases(1950-1959) in my dataset, I found several interesting deviations from current norms of the court– the Hyderabad Bench of the court, Even Panel Formation, and Seriatim decision-making.\nSupreme Court of India in Hyderabad\rThe Constitution of India states that Delhi will be the site for the SCI. The Chief Justice of India, after receiving approval from the president, is allowed to create separate regional benches of the court. Recent commentators on the SCI have advocated for these regional benches and I had always assumed that the Court has never sat outside the capital. I was thus surprised to see three judgments pronounced by the “Supreme Court of India in Hyderabad” in the first year of the Court. These decisions were delivered by Justice Mahajan and two judges who are not part of the list of judges of the Supreme Court - Justice R.S. Naik and Justice Khaliluzzanan.\nThe only information I could find on these cases was in Gadbois’s book. Apparently, around 400 cases that were pending before the Nizam’s privy council in Hyderabad were transferred to the SCI after the Constitution came into force (p.27). Justice Mahajan led the bench due to his knowledge of Urdu, and two judges of the High Court of Hyderabad, Chief Justice R.S. Naik and Justice Khaliluzzanan, were appointed as ad-hoc judges of the SCI to dispose these pending cases. Gadbois says that Mahajan, under similar circumstances, also headed a SCI bench in Kashmir, but I could not find any case from this bench in my dataset.\nGiven the advocacy for regional benches, I was surprised how little attention is given to the fact that the court has actually sat in two other sites and had two ad hoc judges. Apart from the mention in Gadbois book and a few mentions in court websites, I could find no information about the two ad hoc judges or about the Court’s functioning in Hyderabad. The mechanism through which this was done is also unclear. Article 128 of the Indian Constitution mentions that a retired judge of the SCI or High Courts can be appointed ad hoc, but it is unclear if this provision was used here.\n\rEven Panel Formation in the SCI\rAs Nick Robinson has pointed out in his analysis, panel sizes have changed a lot from early days in the SCI. Early on, most cases of the court used to be heard by large panels of either three or five judges. Due to the marked increase in workload in the following decades, most cases in the SCI now are heard by a panel of two judges.\nDespite the importance of panel selection on judicial decision-making, it has received very little scholarly attention. Gupta’s (1995) book is the only one I know of which looked at systematic bias in the formation of benches. Due to the fact that the Chief Justice of India as the “Master of Roster” has unbridled decision in panel formation in the SCI, they do not have to give public reasons for their choice. We thus have no information on why particular people sit in given panels, an issue recently raised at the press conference of SCI judges.\nWe also do not seem to know why a panel of a particular size was formed in a given case. Beyond the constitutional norm of 5 judge panels for “Substantial questions in the interpretation of the constitution”, and current rules mandating certain cases to be heard by atleast 3 judges, we do not know the norms governing panel size. Obviously, one would need a larger panel to overrule a previous decision of a smaller one, but it is unclear what triggers the formation of this larger panel. Presumably, a case is listed before the larger panel, if a smaller panel recommends it, but this is not always the case. For example, in the Sabrimala review case was listed directly before a 9 judge bench, without a reference from the smaller bench.\nBeyond the division bench (two judge bench), the SCI currently sits only in odd-sized panels–3,5,7,9,11 or in one case a bench of 13 judges. The reason is obvious: an odd-sized bench ensures that there is no possibility of a judicial tie and consequently guarantees a resolution of the issue by a majority of the judges1. Odd-number panel formation is a gridlock prevention mechanism. However, when I printed a graph of the bench sizes in the first decade of the court, I found that we had benches of 4, 6, and even 8 judges.\n\rFigure 1: Panel Size in the SCI from 1950-1959\r\rThere were as many as 22 6-judge decisions in the dataset. The norm in early cases heard by the Court was for all judges to sit en banc (as a full court) rather than in smaller panels for important cases. From its inception until the appointment of Justice N. Chandrasekhara Aiyar on 23rd September, 1950, there were only 6 judges in the SCI. All these inaugural judges sat en banc in important cases in the first year of the court, even though the resulting panel was even numbered. For example, the most famous case in India on preventative detention of A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras was given by 6 judges. Similar is the case with Brij Bhushan and Romesh Thappar. This logic was not only limited to constitutional cases. For example, Messrs. Khimji Poonja And Company vs Shri Baldev Das C. Parikh related to a technical interpretation of an arbitration agreement and was heard by all 6 inaugural judges. In fact, most 6-bench cases are not constitutional cases. There are also several 4-judge bench cases, mostly dealing with income tax issues.\nWe see some panels of 6 judges even after the appointment of more judges. For example, The State Of Bombay vs Atma Ram Sridhar Vaidya was a 6-judge bench decision with Justice Aiyar but without Justice Mahajan. This was despite the fact that Justice Mahajan had participated in the deciding Keshavan Madhava Menon vs The State Of Bombay, a 7-judge bench decided just 3 days earlier. The last of the 6-judge benches was Kharak Singh vs The State Of U.P decided as late as 1962, when the court had 14 judges.\nThe sole 8-judge bench M. P. Sharma And Others vs Satish Chandra seems to be the last case following the norm of en banc panels for important cases. The case dealt with the legality of search and seizure as well as the right to privacy and is now mostly overruled by Oghad and Puttaswamy.\n\rSeriatim Decisions\rIn most cases, courts in India have what can be called discretionary authorship, where authorship depends on the individual judges, who may “join” in the opinion of their colleagues or write separate opinions for themselves. This is different from many other courts. For example, the constitutional Court in Germany gives its judgement per curium (as a court) and does not disclose the authors of the opinion. As far as I know, the Ayodhya judgement is the only per curium decision of the SCI. On the other hand, the High Court of Australia follows seriatim decision-making, where it is compulsory for each judge who heard the case to disclose their vote through a separate opinion.\nHowever, in atleast 3 cases in our dataset, I found the practice of seriatim decision making in the SCI. Consider Commissioner Of Agricultural Income Tax vs Sri Keshab Chandra Mandal, a 5-judge bench of the Court where Justice Das wrote the majority opinion and Justice Mukherjea wrote the lone dissent. The other 3 judges however did not join with Justice Das but wrote separate opinions with the words “I agree”2. Similar is the case with Tara Singh v State, a 4-judge bench where Justice Bose wrote the substantive opinion, while Justice Fazl Ali and Sastri wrote an opinion stating “I agree and have nothing to add”, and Justice Das wrote “I agree to the order proposed by my learned brother Bose”.\nThe cases were years apart, with several cases in between having discretionary authorship with judges simply joining opinions that they agreed with. It is unclear what led to this practice in these cases and why these particular cases have this pattern.\n\rThe Need to understand Process\rThese examples highlight how little we know about the internal workings of the Supreme Court of India. Without such a history, it is impossible to deconstruct the decision-making process of the Court. There are many more such norms that we do not know: norms regarding the selective publication of proceedings, norms regarding the selection of cases, norms regarding the allocation of oral hearing time etc. As Epstein and Knight have pointed out, each of these norms allows strategic choices by judges, and has an effect on final decision-making by the Court.\nPart of the blame must lie with the Court itself, which has always been defined by opacity and which seems to have made no effort to document or archive its history. In any event, scholars of the Court must move away from the exclusive focus on its judgments and also examine the background processes that led to these decisions.\n\r\rMany have suggested that an even numbered bench would better suit judicial compromise.↩︎\n\rSimilar was the case in N.P. Ponnuswami vs Returning Officer (1952)↩︎\n\r\r\r","date":1628380800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628380800,"objectID":"ed4c896e4d08191d4a80bab295d397fb","permalink":"https://rahulh.com/post/early-supreme-court/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/early-supreme-court/","section":"post","summary":"I look at three examples of early practices of the Supreme Court of India that highlight how little we know about the institutional history of the court 1) There was a regional bench of the court in Hyderabad, with ad-hoc judges to hear cases 2) There were many even-numbered sized panels of the court suggesting a norm of en banc hearing of important constitutional cases 3) There are examples of seriatim-judgement writing by the court, where all participating judgements gave seperate opinions.","tags":["Supreme Court of India","Regional Benches","History"],"title":"The Need for an Institutional History of the Supreme Court of India: Three Examples from the Early Court","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r\rOne of the most famous studies in judicial politics is Danziger, Levav, and Avnaim-Pesso’s work on the Israeli Parole board. The study concluded that food breaks affected the way that Israeli judges granted parole. Specifically, it found that the rate of granting parole drops gradually from 65% to nearly 0% for each session of the court and returns to 65% after the judges have had their break. The study suggests that this decrease can be attributed to either altered mood or mental depletion, with judges who were getting more tired and hungry taking the status quo option of not granting parole. The study has been challenged inter-alia for selection bias and overestimating effect sizes but remains highly influential.\nDue to the sheer workload of cases, judges at the Indian Judiciary are even more likely to suffer from fatigue. According to a former Chief Justice of India, an Indian judge dealt with an average of 2600 cases in a year, compared to an average of 81 cases by American judges. Even in the Supreme Court of India, the highest court of the country, each panel hears an average of 46 cases for admission on miscellaneous days and 18 cases on regular days. If the theory of depletion is correct, we should particularly see the effect of fatigue in the decision-making of such high workload courts. In this note, I examine the effect of case fatigue on efficiency and decision-making at the Supreme court of India(SCI).\nMethods\rTo do this, I use the Supreme Court Hearing Time Dataset, that I created along with Himanshu Agarwal. The dataset contains information about the hearing time of each case heard by the SCI between 20th January, 2016 till 5th December, 2016. To ensure homogeneity in case-type and to restrict the data-set to a manageable sample, I only look at Special Leave Petitions, the most common case-type in the SCI. This gives us a sample size of 23335 hearings. For each of these hearings, I downloaded the order of the court from the Supreme Court of India Website. Through a computer script, I classified the “winner” in each of these orders. All cases where notice was issued, leave granted, stay granted or appeal allowed were classified as petitioner wins.\nAs a measure of fatigue, I count the number of minutes that have passed from when the court convened till when the court heard a particular case. For example, if the court heard a case at 10:45 AM, 15 minutes after it convened at 10:30 AM, the number of minutes would be coded as 15. Unfortunately, for reasons related to the way the data was collected, we do not have the data for breaks including lunch breaks during the day. As a measure of fatigue, I use the amount of time that the court took for each individual hearing. The intuition here is that as the day goes on, the court needs to listen to more oral arguments in order to make their decision in any individual case1. Finally, as a measure of decision-making, I look at who was the winner in the individual hearing.\nThe assumption that we have to make is that the distribution of cases within a day is random or atleast exogenous to the time allocated to the case and the winner of the case. However, the cause -list is arranged in a way that cases which are being heard for the first time, for admission, are heard first, followed by cases which have been listed before. Presumably, hearings at the notice stage(first hearing) take lesser oral hearing time than hearings at the leave stage, which in turn take even lesser oral hearing time than hearings that occur after the court has granted leave to appeal. To account for this, I control for the stage of hearing through a variable which measures the number of times the case has been heard before. The SCI lists all admission matters for oral hearing on Mondays and Fridays. These are called “miscellaneous days”. Once cases are admitted, they are listed on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. These are called “regular days”. To account for this, I control for the day of the week. Assuming that there is no other systematic bias in the way that the cases are listed throughout the day, we can use regression methods to examine how fatigue affects the court2.\n\rResults\r\rFigure 1: Oral Hearing Time in Miscellenous Days\r\rI find that oral hearing time allocated to a case is positively related to the time at which the case was heard (Table 1). As Figure 1 shows, average hearing time on miscellaneous days increases as the day goes on. It would seem then that as more cases are heard, the court becomes less efficient and takes more time to decide each individual case. As the marginal effects plot(Figure 2) shows,based on my model, a case heard when the court convenes at 10:30 am takes around 5 minutes of hearing time, while a case at the same stage of hearing at 4:00 pm takes 12 minutes, a 140% increase.\n\rFigure 2: Marginal Effect of Time of the Day on Hearing Time\r\rOn the other hand, I find no evidence that decision making is affected by fatigue (Table 1). There is no statistically significant relationship between the time the case is heard and the winner of the case. As Figure 3 shows, the running average of a SLP succeeding in SC remains constant at around 31% at all times of the day on a miscellaneous day. I thus find no evidence that the SCI are more likely to choose the status quo option and dismiss petitions when they are tired.\n\rFigure 3: Average Probability of Win on Miscellenous Days\r\rThese results change when I use an alternative measure of time of the day. Let us assume a cutoff for lunch at 1:30 PM. We can then measure the total time that has passed in each session. As an example, this measure would be 15 at both 10:45 AM and 1:45 PM. Regressing this measure with win probability leads to significant results, but in the opposite direction of our prediction(Table 1). It would seem that the court is more likely to reject petitions at the start of a session than the end of the session. Oral hearing time also increases as the session goes on. These results are not robust- particularly since our selection of the lunch cut-off time is entirely arbitrary– but lunch breaks do seem to matter in some way.\n\rTable 1: Regression Models Predicting Variation in Hearing Time and Win Rates by Time of the Day\r\r\r\r\r\r\rDependent variable:\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rTime heard\r\rPetitioner Winner\r\r\rTime heard\r\r\rPetitioner Winner\r\r\r\r\r\rPoisson\r\rlogistic\r\r\rPoisson\r\r\rlogistic\r\r\r\r\r\r(1)\r\r\r(2)\r\r\r(3)\r\r\r(4)\r\r\r(5)\r\r\r\r\r\r\rTime of the day(hours)\r\r\r0.228***\r\r\r0.025\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r(0.0003)\r\r\r(0.023)\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rTime since last break(hours)\r\r\r\r\r\r\r0.097***\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r(0.035)\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rTuesday\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r0.848***\r\r\r-0.144**\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r(0.001)\r\r\r(0.069)\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rWednesday\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r0.657***\r\r\r0.300***\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r(0.001)\r\r\r(0.078)\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rThursday\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r1.085***\r\r\r-0.073\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r(0.002)\r\r\r(0.126)\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rFriday\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r-0.280***\r\r\r-0.053\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r(0.001)\r\r\r(0.052)\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rNumber of Previous Hearings\r\r\r0.007***\r\r\r0.006***\r\r\r0.006***\r\r\r0.007***\r\r\r0.007***\r\r\r\r\r\r(0.00002)\r\r\r(0.002)\r\r\r(0.002)\r\r\r(0.00002)\r\r\r(0.002)\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rMiscellenous Day\r\r\r-0.672***\r\r\r-0.322***\r\r\r-0.331***\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r(0.001)\r\r\r(0.069)\r\r\r(0.069)\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rConstant\r\r\r6.014***\r\r\r-0.575***\r\r\r-0.640***\r\r\r5.550***\r\r\r-0.852***\r\r\r\r\r\r(0.001)\r\r\r(0.072)\r\r\r(0.075)\r\r\r(0.001)\r\r\r(0.040)\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rObservations\r\r\r16,564\r\r\r8,109\r\r\r8,109\r\r\r17,029\r\r\r9,826\r\r\r\rLog Likelihood\r\r\r-7,671,316.000\r\r\r-5,047.505\r\r\r-5,044.136\r\r\r-7,468,741.000\r\r\r-6,048.497\r\r\r\rAkaike Inf.

The probability that a petitioner will win increases with each effective hearing of the case. This conforms to our intuition about the admission process in the SCI. As Khaitan(2020) and Chandra, Hubbard and Kalantry(2017) have pointed out, the court issues notice and grants leave to a limited number of petitions based on the chance that the petition will succeed. It is not a surprise then, that the further down the petition is in the litigation cycle, the more likely the chance that it will succeed.\n\rDay of the Week Fatigue\rI also looked at whether the day of the week in which the matter was heard affects either efficiency or decision-making. We would expect that the court allocates more time to cases on regular days and would also expect that petitioners are more likely to win on regular days.Depletion theory would also predict that the court is likely to be more fatigued when hearing cases on Monday, than on Friday where the judges are presumably fatigued from the work that happened during the week. Thus, judges should take more time to decide cases and be more likely to decide cases on Fridays than on Mondays.\n\rFigure 4: Average Hearing Time by Day of the Week\r\rLike with the time of the day analysis, I find no evidence of any difference in win rates between the two miscellaneous days. However, as the figure 4 shows there is a significant differences between the hearing time across days. Contrary to the fatigue hypothesis, cases on Mondays, on average, are heard longer than cases on Fridays(Table 1). There is also a difference between the average hearing time on regular days. I don’t know whether this is representative of some difference in listing practices. The relationship remains significant on the addition of controls for subject matter and stage of hearing.\n\rDiscussion and Further Work\rWe find that while efficiency (the time it takes for completing a hearing) may change based on the time of the day as well as the day of the week, decision-making in the court remains unaffected by fatigue. There may be a few reasons for these results. First, unlike the Israeli parole board, judges of the SCI have the discretion to simply adjourn or pass-over the case. When they are fatigued, it is possible that judges intentionally adjourn cases that they believe will take more effort and time. Second, we only tested a limited timeline, and did not control for judge-level effects. It is possible that some judges thrive under the high workload while others are pressured by it. Third, fatigue might have indirect effects- for e.g. the court might dictate orders of lower quality when under pressure. I hope to examine a few of these questions in future posts.\n\r\rIt is also possible to theorize the opposite hypothesis– judges may take less time for each case when fatigued, since they would like to default to status-quo.↩︎\n\rFor the efficiency model, I use poisson regression to regress time heard with time of the day. For the decision model, I use logit regression to regress winner(1 for petitioner,0 for other) with time of the day. In each case, the number of prior hearings in the case as well as a dichotomous variable for whether the case was heard on a miscellaneous day.↩︎\n\r\r\r","date":1627948800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627948800,"objectID":"83ac8486d6a6bfd1e8d9620bfd80862e","permalink":"https://rahulh.com/post/judges-lunch/","publishdate":"2021-08-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/judges-lunch/","section":"post","summary":"Analyzing over 23000 hearings, I examine if the time when a case is heard in the Supreme Court of India affects either the allocation of oral hearing time or decision-making in that case.
